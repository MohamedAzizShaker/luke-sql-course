# Background 
Welcome to my first SQL project! ðŸŽ‰

This project marks my initial foray into the world of SQL, where Iâ€™ve applied foundational skills and techniques learned through a comprehensive course. The journey began with a fantastic resource: [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mz73uXD9DA) which provided invaluable insights into SQL querying, database design, and management.

The course covered a range of topics from basic SELECT statements to more advanced JOIN operations and database functions, giving me a solid foundation to build upon. Iâ€™ve used this knowledge to develop this project, which showcases my ability to create, manipulate, and query databases effectively.   
# Tools I Used
For my deep dive into the data analyst job market, I harnessed the power of several key tools:

- **SQL:** The backbone of my analysis, allowing me to query the database and unearth critical insights.
- **PostgreSQL:** The chosen database management system, ideal for handling the job posting data.
- **Visual Studio Code:** My go-to for database management and executing SQL queries.
- **Git & GitHub:** Essential for version control and sharing my SQL scripts and analysis, ensuring collaboration and project tracking. 
# The Analysis
Each query for this project aimed at investigating specific aspects of the data analyst job market. Hereâ€™s how I approached each question:
### 1. Top Paying Data Analyst Jobs
To identify the highest-paying roles, I filtered data analyst positions by average yearly salary and location, focusing on remote jobs. This query highlights the high paying opportunities in the field.

``` sql
SELECT
    job_id,
    job_title,
    job_location,
    job_schedule_type,
    salary_year_avg,
    job_posted_date,
    name as Company_Name
FROM
    job_postings_fact
LEFT JOIN
     company_dim
USING
     (company_id)
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
    job_location = 'Anywhere' AND
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL

ORDER BY
         salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
Here's the breakdown of the top data analyst jobs in 2023:
- **Wide Salary Range:** Top 10 paying data analyst roles span from $184,000 to $650,000, indicating significant salary potential in the field.

- **Job Title Variety:** There's a high diversity in job titles, from Data Analyst to Director of Analytics, reflecting varied roles and specializations within data analytics.
### 2. Skills for Top Paying Jobs
To understand what skills are required for the top-paying jobs, I joined the job postings with the skills data, providing insights into what employers value for high-compensation roles.
``` sql
WITH Top_paying_Jobs AS(
    SELECT
        job_id,
        job_title,
        salary_year_avg,
        name as Company_Name
    FROM
        job_postings_fact
    LEFT JOIN
        company_dim
    USING
        (company_id)
    WHERE
        job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
        job_location = 'Anywhere' AND
        salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL

    ORDER BY
        salary_year_avg DESC
    LIMIT 10
)
SELECT
    Top_paying_Jobs.*,
    skills
FROM
    Top_paying_Jobs
JOIN
    skills_job_dim
USING
    (job_id)
JOIN
    skills_dim
USING
    (skill_id)
ORDER BY
  salary_year_avg DESC;
  ```
  Here's the breakdown of the most demanded skills for the top 10 highest paying data analyst jobs in 2023:
- **SQL** is leading with a bold count of 8.

### 3. In-Demand Skills for Data Analysts

This query helped identify the skills most frequently requested in job postings, directing focus to areas with high demand.
``` sql
SELECT 
    skills,
    COUNT(SJD.job_id) AS demand_count
FROM
    job_postings_fact JPF
INNER JOIN
    skills_job_dim SJD ON JPF.job_id = SJD.job_id
INNER JOIN
    skills_dim SD ON SJD.skill_id = SD.skill_id
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' 
GROUP BY skills
ORDER BY demand_count DESC
LIMIT 5;
```
Here's the breakdown of the most demanded skills for data analysts in 2023
- **SQL** and **Excel** remain fundamental, emphasizing the need for strong foundational skills in data processing and spreadsheet manipulation.

### 4. Skills Based on Salary
Exploring the average salaries associated with different skills revealed which skills are the highest paying.
``` sql
SELECT 
    skills,
    ROUND(AVG(salary_year_avg), 2) AS avg_salary
FROM
    job_postings_fact JPF
INNER JOIN
    skills_job_dim SJD ON JPF.job_id = SJD.job_id
INNER JOIN
    skills_dim SD ON SJD.skill_id = SD.skill_id
WHERE
